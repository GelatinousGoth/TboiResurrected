the darkest pit of 
hell has opened to 
swallow you whole

don't keep the 
devil waiting

have a rotten day

you'll always
come in last place

ragequit, i dare ya

what is your
major malfunction

you only have 
yourself to blame 

god isn't cruel
she just hates you

there's a pebble
in your shoe

the bedbugs
will bite you

you have lice

your problems 
will never go away 

they'll send you
to a home

you'll end up
6ft below

nerd!

what is wrong 
with you?

everything wants 
you dead

you will be betrayed
by those who mean 
the most to you

*drinks your tears*

they'll never accept
you

your shoelaces
are untied

one size fits all,
except you

darkness consumes
you 

your bones feel
weaker

you will never see 
daylight again 

you are an umbral
creature, those eyes
are souless

it stings...

you're up past 
curfew

Why?

you're a good person
(lying)

you won't survive

you're a burden

you're such a baby

waste of life.

your cuts are dirty

i win
you lose

go back home

loser!

your presence 
fades away 

no shirts
no shoes
no service

i'm not sorry

i love you
...just kidding

lightning will 
strike you twice

you should turn
to a
life of crime

3, 2, 1...
CRY!

there are
moths in your
pantry

your room
is filled with
spiders

Tragic...

Be Better.

you have been 
cursed

judgement 
descends upon you 

i've deleted
your save file

you can never 
be right

say hi to guppy
for me 

writhe in pain 

there is no god

heaven is a lie

a loving god
wouldn't have
abandoned you

there's no difference
between reality and 
your imagination

be torn 
limb from limb 

outcast by all 

your father left
you behind 

you are losing
access to your 
own mind 

escape is impossible

no past or future
anymore

you are insane.

stuck in an infinite
room, full of white noise

they call for you,
your time is up

Isaac is missing

you will die alone,
well before she 
finds you 

it's arrival signals 
your departure 

think about the time
you have wasted

i hope you find peace,
even if i know you 
can't 

your wrists feel...

find the truth
before it kills you 

go to sleep
...forever

you looked better
with hair

driven mad upon 
the rocks

you're split between 
anger and shame

reduced to nothing 
but regret and 
affliction

suffocate.

your scars spread 
all over your body 

hurts, doesn't it?

you haven't even 
been through the 
worst of it 

forever a child 

no second chances

the nights are 
getting longer 

your proportions
are off

everything ends
eventually

you have a face
only a mother
could love

insides are out,
strewn around the 
room

you are no longer 
able to smile

everyone is
noticing
your flaws

you are your own 
greatest enemy
and tormentor

like icarus, you've 
flown too close
to the sun 

oh the agony

you disgust me.

what have you done?!

timeout!
go to the naughty
corner

you are going to
age and wither away

stuck in limbo,
a purgatory of 
cycle

this time, 
you've gone too far

pathetic.

the pressure will 
crush your soul 

you were robbed of 
your humanity

I see you for what 
you really are 

i would say
it's over but
you never started

never once
did you try

why even bother?

your name
doesn't suit you

find meaning in 
the suffering

what a depressing 
existence...

there's no saving
yourself, bring 
everyone down with you 

it's too late

life has
no meaning

you leave death 
and destruction 
in your wake 

you will be
forgotten

rivers of blood 
flow wherever you 
are 

your hatred runs
deep

you cannot 
accomplish anything

feel the guilt
in your stomach?

you'll always be
in the wrong

Bad Boy!

kill or be killed

your vision gets 
hazy

you'd better apologize

it's all gonna
crash and burn

you are a parasite

you look like
an orphan

bad memories 
will always plague 
your mind

this will never end

stare into the sun

the gods are
watching you

after you die
it's just nothing
forever

faker

you bleed from within

stop trying

you'll never get
those years back

your parents
never loved you

you deserve 
this fate

there's a reason
you don't have friends

it was all your fault

your friends are
talking behind 
your back 

that's not you
in the mirror

lay down and die

play dead!

be someone else

you have zero
redeeming qualities

wipe away your being

the sky is falling!

overdose.

you deserve
to get bullied

a few seconds
closer to death

you're not worth it

you were a mistake

don't have children

don't be yourself,
it's embarrassing

you're never
gonna make it

how much longer 
can you last?
